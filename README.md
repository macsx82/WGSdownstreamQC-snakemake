# Details for the QC of WGS data after joint calling

This pipeline will performed some QC steps on a complete dataset considering the following parameters:

Sample related:

* PCA
* Singleton distribution
* Missingness
* Coverage
* Heterozygosity rate

Variant related:

* HWE
* Heterozygosity rate
* Call rate
* AF comparison with outbred populations

Samples and variants comparison with SNP array data (available only for samples of the FVG cohort):

* MAF mismatch with SNP array data
* NRDR

The pipeline will generate lists of samples or sites flagged for removal to generate the final dataset.

Only by sites hwe and callrate filters will be applied automatically.

The final data release has to be generated by hand, excluding samples and sites following the evaluation of the generated summaries (tables and plots)
